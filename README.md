## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Utilizes a KNN classifier to predict the presence or absence of cardiovascular disease based on multiple input features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm:** Employs the KNN algorithm to classify the target variable by identifying the k-nearest data points within the training set.
- **Feature Selection:** Considers relevant features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation:** Incorporates evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained KNN model.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a heart disease dataset containing various attributes, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other pertinent information. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, enabling the model to learn from the training data and evaluate its performance on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

To run the Jupyter Notebook and execute the heart disease prediction code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
